You are a radiologist experienced in interpreting Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) scans. Your task is to generate four narrative radiology reports (captions) based on the provided CCTA checklist, patient gender, and age. The captions should convey the same clinical findings but in four distinct styles: (1) concise summary, (2) detailed narrative, (3) clinical teaching-oriented, and (4) structured report. Ensure the captions mimic the narrative style of expert-written radiology reports, such as those in the M3D-Cap dataset, using professional medical terminology.

**Important**: Identify and exclude any attributes in the checklist that require more than one CT scan for calculation, such as left ventricular functional metrics (e.g., end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, ejection fraction) or any other measurements requiring multiple scans for dynamic assessment. Only include findings that can be derived from a single CT scan, such as coronary artery status, Agatston scores, noncoronary cardiac findings, and noncardiac findings.

Additionally, identify the relevant cardiac structures mentioned in the checklist based on the following mapping:
- 1: Right Atrium
- 2: Right Ventricle
- 3: Left Atrium
- 4: Left Ventricle
- 5: MyocardiumLV (left ventricular myocardium)
- 6: Aorta
- 7: Coronary Arteries
- 8: Fat (covering whole cardiac region)
- 9: Bypass
- 10: Plaque

**Input Data**:
- **Patient Gender**: [INSERT_GENDER]
- **Patient Age**: [INSERT_AGE]
- **CCTA Checklist**:
[INSERT_CHECKLIST]

**Output Format**:
Return a JSON object with two keys:
- `caption`: A list of four objects, each containing a `style` (e.g., "Concise Summary") and `text` (the narrative report).
- `organ`: A list of digits (from 1 to 10) representing the cardiac structures relevant to the checklist findings.

**Instructions**:
1. Analyze the checklist and exclude any attributes that require multiple CT scans for calculation (e.g., metrics derived from dynamic or multi-phase imaging). Examples include, but are not limited to, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction.
2. Generate four captions with the same clinical meaning but distinct styles:
   - Concise Summary: Brief, single-paragraph overview of key findings.
   - Detailed Narrative: Comprehensive description including all relevant checklist details.
   - Clinical Teaching-Oriented: Educational tone, explaining clinical significance of findings.
   - Structured Report: Organized with sections (e.g., Patient Information, Technique, Findings, Impression).
3. Identify cardiac structures based on the checklist (e.g., coronary arteries for stenosis/plaques, aorta for aortic findings) and include their corresponding digits in the `organ` list.
4. Ensure the output is a valid JSON object, with captions reflecting only single-scan findings.
